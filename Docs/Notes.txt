Trying to build FPGAConfig

1>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5055,5): warning MSB3061: Unable to delete file "C:\jdubb\workspaces\CorrelatorProject\correlatorproject.r149.git\DcsAppForm\FPGAConfig\bin\Debug\FPGAConfig.exe". Access to the path 'C:\jdubb\workspaces\CorrelatorProject\correlatorproject.r149.git\DcsAppForm\FPGAConfig\bin\Debug\FPGAConfig.exe' is denied.

Answer:  You need to check "Use Managed Compatibility Mode" in Tools|Options|Debugging|General.

The only thing that worked is copying the VS project files from CollectData/FPGAConfig (which does work) to DcsAppForm/FPGAConfig

In creating a git project from correlatorproject removed ./SimData/simData.bin because it is 500 MB - which is too large for a free github account. Replaced with an empty file ./SimData/simData.bin place holder.
